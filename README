To compile the program execute in the terminal:

$make


To run the program execute:

$make run


All the outputs are written into the directory "outputfile" given in the 
parameters module (param.f90).

! ===========================================================================
! Library to evolve an arbitry physical system on a 1 dimensional grid using 
! a Runge-Kutta 4 method. Also includes memory allocation and output routines.

 The structures used in the library are:

  !Functions on the grid to be integrated
  type :: dynamical_func

  !Extra functions that are not evolve
  type :: extra_func


 The routines in the library are:

  !Implemetation of the Runge-Kutta 4 method 
  subroutine evolution_rk4(k,func,time_step)

  !Store the initial values before the integration
  subroutine store_levels_rk4(func)

  !Allocation of function that are evolve
  subroutine allocate_dyn(func,grid_points)

  !Allocation of the function that are not evolve
  subroutine allocate_extra(func,grid_points)

  !Deallocation of function that are evolve
  subroutine deallocate_dyn(func)

  !Allocation of function that are not evolve
  subroutine deallocate_extra(func)

  !Created the output file for the dynamical functions "func" in  
  !the "output_dir" with name "output_file" and id "file_number"
  subroutine create_output(func,output_dir,output_file,file_number)

  !Print the output of two scalar functions on the grid
  subroutine output_obs_obs(axis1,axis2,output_file,file_number,Nx)
